'''Basic Variables

# Create two different variables that will take the input of your first name and your neighbors first name.

MyName= input("what is your name?")
NeighborsName= input("what is your neighbors name?")

'''Create two more inputs that will ask how many months each of you have been coding.

time1= int(input("how many months have you been coding?"))

'''Finally, display a result with both your names and the total amount of months coding.
print("I am " + MyName and "my neighbors name is" + NeighborsName)
